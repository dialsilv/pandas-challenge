The trends I notice in the data are:
- Charter schools have better averages than District schools. The % of Math passing students in District schools is considerably lower comparing to Charter schools. This creates a flag to investigate what is going on in District schools, or even go deeper and understand which school is driving this bad result. Having checked if there is a school driving this bad stat, I found out that there is no "visible driver". Out of curiosity I also setup the stats distribution per school type and size. It was interesting to see that the District schools are all big.
- The schools with lower avg spending per student have actually better stats than the schools with higher spendings
- Smaller schools have better averages than bigger schools.
