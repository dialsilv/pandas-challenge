The trends I notice in the data are:
- Charter schools have better averages than District schools. The % of Math passing students in District schools is considerably lower comparing to Charter schools. This creates a flag to investigate what is going on in District schools, or even go deeper and understand which school is driving this bad result. Having checked the schools in details, I found out that there is no "visible school leader". Out of curiosity, I also setup the stats distribution per school type and size. It was interesting to see that the District schools are all big, maybe suggesting that there is not enough time spent per student in order to improve the grades.
- The schools with higher average spending per student do not have better stats than the schools with lower spendings. This suggests that the spent dollars are not being properly used to improve students grades. I would ask more details about the spending per school, so that we could understand if all the schools have the same kind of spendings.
